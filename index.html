      <p>I have completed my Master's degree in CS from University of Illinois at Chicago and Bachelor's degree in ECE from Graphic Era University, India. Previously, I have at Chitown Home Care where I worked on creating new web pages and maintaining the web. I have a work experience of 5+ years as a Software Developer.</p>
      <ul>I have worked on the following tech:
        <li>Java</li>
        <li>Spring</li>

      <p>After working as a backend developer, I am inspired to learn Frontend as to know how everything works and can help my team. Being a student at Thinkful is really great as the explanation is easy.</p>
